AGL Elastic Marmousi


# Statement

The AGL Elastic Marmousi model was created at the University of Houston,
and was released by its authors Gary S. Martin, Robert Wiley and Kurt J. 
Marfurt with the permission of the program director of the Allied 
Geophysical Labs consortium in 2019.


# Description

The AGL elastic Marmousi model, also commonly referred to as the Marmousi2
model, is an elastic extension of the original Marmousi model created by 
Gary S. Martin, Robert Wiley and Kurt J. Marfurt (2004, 2006). The model 
has a lateral extension of 17 km and a depth of 3.5 km and includes a 
total of 199 layers geological layers, as well as an extended water layer
of 450 m depth to simulate a deep water setting. The layers were derived
from the same horizon picks that were used for the original Marmousi model
and were supplied by Aline Bourgeois from the Institut Francais du Petrole
(IFP). The simulated data were computed on a supercomputer system at the 
University of Houston (UH), supported by Sun Microsystems. The data set 
includes subsurface models for density, P-wave and S-wave velocity, as well
as a series of processed data sets (NMO stacks, pre- and poststack time and 
depth migrated sections).
